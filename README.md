# WebScraper
Web scraper in python3 using request and beatifulsoup modules.
Using my web scraper you can search and download images. Each search will generate a folder as long as it dosen't already exist.


What is BeautifulSoup? BeautifulSoup is a third party Python library from Crummy. The library is designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping.
Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it and does the tree traversal
stuff for you. 

You can use it to find all the links of a website

Find all the links whose urls match "foo.com"

Find the table heading thatâ€™s got bold text, then give me that text.

Find every "a" element that has an href attribute etc.
